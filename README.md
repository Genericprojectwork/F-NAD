# F-NAD  An Application for Fake News Article Detection using Machine Learning Techniques.
The project propose a machine learning approach to classify a news article whether it is "Fake" or "Real" news. It proposes a hybrid model based on LSTM and GRUto classify the news article. The research paper on this topic is being accepted and presented in IBSSC-2019, IIT-Bombay.
## About the Repository
The Repository contains sample dataset used for training/testing the model. Test.zip contains 500 real and 500 fake news. While F-NAD sample contains 10 real and fake news.
