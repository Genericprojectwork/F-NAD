Melbourne.Indian bowlers had a great day today as they gave India a massive lead and a chance to go ahead in the series.But the Indian batting failed miserably after Kohli refused to enforce the follow-on.Pujara and Kohli did their best to promote Anishka’s Zero and were soon seen returning to pavilion in the second innings.Rahane meanwhile scored one run which was of no use as it broke the chain started by Kohli and Pujara.Kohli was seen very angry in the dressing room and even abused Rahane for failing to promote his wife’s movie.In fact, secret sources have revealed that the Indian team was so confident of winning the Test match that they decided to dedicate the second innings to Kohli’s wife Anushka’s movie promotion.Actually Zero has been a big failure on box office and Kohli and team are trying their level best to contribute some effort in bringing Anushka out of the pathetic situation.Anand L Rai has also thanked the Indian Team to go all out there in Australia for the movie promotion.Anand L Rai is sure that the film which didn’t do well in multiplexes will be a hit among Television viewers as the Indian team has promoted the movie well.
