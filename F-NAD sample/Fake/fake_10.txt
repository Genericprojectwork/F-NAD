New Delhi: Government of India has launched a new app which would help people to know what needs to be linked with Aadhaar before which deadline.Unique Identification Authority of India (UIADI) which comes under the supervision of central government has launched the new app for Android, iOS as well as Windows devices.While speaking to us, UIADI CEO, A.K.Pandey said, “It is humanly impossible to remember what all one needs to do to become cent percent Aadhaar complaint.I am doing it diligently for me and my family members for last four months, still there are so many checklists pending for us.Can understand the pain of my fellow Indians who must be getting a dozen smses everyday informing what all you need to link with Aadhaar.”While giving us a demo of the app, Mr. Pandey said, “Click on one date, say Dec 31st, 2017, you will see what all you must link before that date like bank account, Mutual fund holdings, Pan Card, blah, blah, blah.Similarly, if you click on another date, say, Feb 6th, 2018, you will see a tab saying you have to link your mobile sim card before this date.There is a long list of items one needs to do as of today.Then Aadhaar linking is a never-ending process, time to time we will be keep on adding new items to the list”.On the benefits of Aadhaar, Mr. Pandey said, “Long list of benefits already mentioned in UIADI website.If that is not sufficient, regularly listen to ‘mann ki baat’ and from time to time Jaitley Ji speaks on ‘cess ki baat’ where he and his finance ministry colleagues talk about Aadhaar benefits.”As expected like any Government app, this app also crashed within minutes.People are hoping as deadline comes close many websites that demand Aadhaar linking will crash due to overloading which will compel Government to move the deadlines.Yeh silsila with aadhaar chalta rahega humesha ke liye.
