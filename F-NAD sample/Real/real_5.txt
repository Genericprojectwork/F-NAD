1.It's been a forgettable year for South Australian football For just the fourth time in 22 seasons since Port Adelaide joined Adelaide in the national competition in 1997, there won't be a South Australian club in the finals.The Power were challenging for the top-two before losing six of their last seven games to collapse in dramatic fashion.The post-mortems will be just as intense at West Lakes after the Crows went from grand finalists one year to taking September vacations the next.Both clubs will be busy during the NAB AFL Trade Period with the futures of Jared Polec and Mitch McGovern up in the air.The silver lining is the amount of exciting South Australian talent in this year's draft, highlighted by Jack Lukosius, Izak Rankine, Connor Rozee, Jackson Hately and Jez McLennan.- Lee Gaskin2.The Pies have to go to another level to be a genuine premiership threat After finishing the season with 15 wins, Nathan Buckley insisted the Magpies wouldn't be scared of anyone when finals roll around, and that's fair, but they will need to find another gear if they are to seriously challenge as a flag contender.Collingwood scraped over the line against a plucky Fremantle outfit on Saturday and boasts a 4-1 record interstate, but those three other road victories have only come against Gold Coast, Brisbane and Adelaide.Meanwhile, the Pies have only beaten one other finalist, Melbourne, this season.Yes, the Maggies deserve plaudits for overcoming a crippling injury list to earn a double-chance in September, but you'd think they will need the likes of Adam Treloar, Jeremy Howe and Darcy Moore back fit and firing, and for a lot else to go right, to really push the likes of Richmond on the big stage.- Travis King3.The Demons are not flat-track bullies We can put this one to bed.Melbourne was a statistical darling all season and crushed lowly teams for fun, but when push came to shove on the bigger stages it fell over all too familiarly.That is until round 22, when the Demons finally made a stand, on the road in Perth against the second-placed Eagles, to secure a long-awaited first finals berth since 2006.Coach Simon Goodwin remained patient and composed throughout the exhilarating highs and debilitating lows, repeatedly stating how close his men were to a serious breakthrough.There were justifiable doubts externally, but Goodwin and his team clearly knew what was unfolding.This Melbourne side has transformed from the one mocked seven years ago by then-Blue Mitch Robinson for playing "bruise-free" football into the AFL's undisputed king of contested ball.Greater Western Sydney was the great threat to that title and in a match that counted plenty for both clubs, the Demons smashed the Giants 139-111 in contested possession .How's that for making a statement?An even bigger one is there to be made if Melbourne can fulfil its promise in the September glare.- Marc McGowan4.The Tigers still aren't at their best … but know how to be Their three-point win over the Bulldogs wasn't their best victory, but who could blame them – their top-of-the-table status was locked in last week, they were assured a home final, and they couldn't help but aim at Jack Riewoldt as he vied for his third Coleman Medal.They also managed Trent Cotchin with limited minutes after he missed last week with hamstring soreness.Damien Hardwick said after the game they still knew how to win; after all, they have notched 18 victories this season.But they're under no illusions they have to be better if they're to contend in the September series, and with Kane Lambert expected to return in the first final, Dan Butler to push for selection in a VFL qualifying final next week, an expected improvement in Cotchin's output after another week off and a rejuvenated Dustin Martin flying into the finals after finding his mojo, they're still in good shape – and will spend the next two weeks ironing their kinks to ensure they take it up to likely opponent Hawthorn.- Jennifer Phelan5.Efficiency is the difference for sorry Blues How is it possible to win the inside 50 count, but lose by 104 points ?That's the question Brendon Bolton may ponder throughout the entire summer, as the Blues coach plans for an important 2019 season.Carlton won several significant statistical categories in Saturday night's heavy defeat, amassing more inside 50s (61-54), clearances (37-30) and contested possessions (145-128), but still got absolutely belted by an efficient Adelaide outfit.Therein lies the problem the Blues have battled with all year.They conceded 35 scoring shots from 54 entries, while averaging just a point per offensive entry themselves.Defensively, they looked unorganised – allowing the Crows to kick nine goals from within 15m out.Offensively, there were too many fundamental skill errors – enabling their opponents to hurt them on the turnover and stream the ball easily through the middle of the field.There's no doubt when Carlton eventually returns for pre-season training ahead of 2019, there's one word Bolton will continually be emphasising – efficiency.- Riley Beveridge6.The Hawks owned all the key moments in Sydney again Sydney might have been without Lance Franklin and Luke Parker , but the way the Hawks responded to their poor second term when they were 26 points down at one stage, confirmed their flag credentials .Jarryd Roughead, Paul Puopolo, Luke Breust and Jack Gunston were hardly sighted in the first half, but all had an influence at pivotal moments when the game was up for grabs.Tom Mitchell had been blanketed by George Hewett but had a big third term.The team's younger players were also huge.Harry Morrison's brilliant individual goal inspired the visitors, while a brutal tackle by Conor Nash on Jake Lloyd caused a crucial turnover that spilled to Roughead and allowed the skipper to find Breust in the goal square for the sealer.With gun defenders James Sicily and James Frawley likely back for their first final, the Hawks will be dangerous in September.- Adam Curley7.Scooter is ready to answer the call Unless the Cats come up against Dustin Martin or Tom Mitchell this finals series, Scott Selwood has proven he must play as a permanent forward.Thrown into attack in recent weeks , the 28-year-old has lifted the Cats' pressure in attack in the absence of a traditional small, crumbing forward.Prior to round 22, the Cats hadn't played a single match without one of Cory Gregson, Lincoln McCarthy, Lachie Fogarty, Jamaine Jones or Quinton Narkle.Now, the latter four names will find it difficult to fight their way back in with Selwood's transformation from a defensive midfielder set to continue in September.What Selwood lacks in raw speed, he makes up for in sheer competitiveness.- Mitch Cleary8.Final locked in at home, but the Eagles again prove they're road warriors West Coast might have gone in as favourite against Brisbane but playing for the all-important second spot and a week one home final, the trip to the Gabba could have been a tricky one.But sweeping the Lions aside by 26 points – and rarely being troubled – again showed how far Adam Simpson's men have come in 2018.Once known as 'Flat track bullies' for their ability to punish teams outside the top eight but struggle against the contenders, the Eagles have won a stunning seven interstate games this season.They've knocked over fellow top-four teams Collingwood and Hawthorn as well as Greater Western Sydney among others on the road and won in every state bar Tasmania.With Josh Kennedy and Lewis Jetta to come in for the qualifying final against the Magpies, the Eagles can enter that match brimming with confidence, but also know that when they eventually play interstate in September, they're now a strong chance of walking away victors.- Michael Whiting9.Rowan Marshall is one positive to rise from the Saints' shocking season The key forward played 12 games for St Kilda this year, having started the season with just one AFL appearance to his name (against round 18 last year).But in a season of many lows for the club, Marshall's development should be viewed as a highlight.Marshall was good again in the Saints' loss to North Melbourne on Sunday, gathering 16 disposals, nine marks and also kicking a goal.He is athletic, presents well on the lead and looks like he has a future in attack for the Saints.Josh Bruce has been missing with a broken leg, but won't necessarily be a walk-up start for the Saints next year if Marshall continues to progress over summer.
