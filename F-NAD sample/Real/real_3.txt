North Korea's state newspaper has accused the US of "hatching a criminal plot to unleash a war against the DPRK" while "having a dialogue with a smile on its face" .The editorial followed a report on South Korean radio that American forces in Japan were running drills aimed at invading Pyongyang."We cannot but take a serious note of the double-dealing attitudes of the US,” the commentary from North Korea's Rodong Sinmun read.North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, accompanied by his wife Ri Sol Ju, visits a construction site in the Wonsan-Kalma coastal tourist area.(AP)President Donald Trump halted plans for his secretary of state to visit North Korea again over a lack of progress on denuclearisation.(AP)"The US would be sadly mistaken if it thinks that it can browbeat someone through trite 'gunboat diplomacy' which it used to employ as an almighty weapon in the past and attain its sinister intention," it added.US Forces Japan told CNN it was "not aware of the drills" mentioned in North or South Korean media reports."In general, US aircrafts and ships operate from Japan every day in support of our commitments to our allies and partners in the region and in the interests of regional peace and security," Col.

rhetoric from Pyongyang comes just days after President Donald Trump halted plans for Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to make what would have been his fourth visit to North Korea, citing insufficient progress on the issue of denuclearisation."I have asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo not to go to North Korea, at this time, because I feel we are not making sufficient progress with respect to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula," Trump tweeted on Friday."Secretary Pompeo looks forward to going to North Korea in the near future, most likely after our trading relationship with China is resolved."A diplomatic source told CNN that while it is possible that high-ranking officials in Seoul were informed of Trump's decision to cancel the trip prior to the tweets, the announcement caught South Korean diplomats off guard.The June 12 Trump-Kim meeting in Singapore which gave hope for peace on the Korean pensinsular.(AP)South Korean President Moon Jae-in plans to visit Pyongyang next

peninsula "at any cost."The ongoing animosity between Pyongyang and Tokyo threatens to mar progress as the region and the US attempt to sway North Korea to abandon its nuclear ambitions in exchange for economic relief and diplomatic acceptance.The two nations are so far from rapprochement that barely a day passes without blistering condemnation of Japan in North Korea's state media.Shinzo Abe has met President Donald Trump regularly as he looks to promote Japanese interests in the South East Asia region.(AP)In the latest vitriol directed at Tokyo, North Korean state media claimed that Japan was engaged in naval exercises with British forces to police the shipment of goods to North Korea "under the pretext of strengthening the capability of monitoring the waters surrounding Japan"."These are acts to check the climate of peace being created on the Korean Peninsula at any cost and ratchet up tension in the region," said KCNA.The bad blood between the two nations dates back at least to the Japanese annexation of the Korean peninsula in 1910, an event routinely referenced in North Korea media.On August 23, North Korea's permanent mission to the United Nations issued a statement drawing attention to the "108 years since the Japanese gangsters cooked up 'Korea-Japan Annexation Treaty.'"Soldiers at the Demilitarised Zone on the border between North and South Korea, whose leaders are soon due to meet for a third time.(AP)Describing the treaty used to justify the annexation as an "illegal document for invasion," the statement argued that Japan has failed to atone for its wartime actions."Japan, overheated with militarist frenzy, has to keenly realise that it can never go to the future with their crime-woven past left pending," the statement went on."At a time when the new trend for peace created on the Korean peninsula has massive impact on the world political situation, and there witnesses a drastic change in the relations of dynamics in the region, only Japan is being treated like an outcast," it said.The victorious North Korean weighlifting team at the Asian Games in Jakarta show off their medals yesterday.(AP)That statement, while incendiary, will likely strike a nerve for Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.Indeed, as North Korea points out, much of the international community has turned from viewing Pyongyang as a malicious uncontrollable threat to a possible returnee to the world's stage.Japan has been the outlier, beseeching the world, and President Donald Trump, not to trust Kim Jong Un and his regime."Abe is really trying and hoping he's not going to be marginalized no matter what happens between Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump," said Koichi Nakano, a professor of political science at Sophia University in Japan."There is a real danger at the end of the day that Abe's Japan will have to pay the price for whatever changes are implemented by North Korea, without having a say in the decision itself," he told CNN.That danger explains Abe's shuttle diplomacy , his dozens of phone calls with President Trump and at least eight face-to-face meetings since Trump came into office.Abe has met Trump at the White House, at Mar-a-Lago in Florida, at G7 summits around the world, as well as in Japan, all to press the American president to keep Japan's interests at the forefront of his negotiations with North Korea.Abe has also been pressing Trump to remember the fate of Japanese citizens abducted by North Korea.A report in 2014 by the United Nations Human Rights Council concluded that hundreds of South Koreans, Japanese and other foreign nationals were kidnapped by North Korea after the end of the Korean War in 1953.Two former South Korean victims sit next the statue symbolising a comfort woman in Seoul on

drives the Koreans crazy is the issue of the comfort women, the North Koreans have made a number of public protests that Japan has failed to acknowledge," he told CNN.That explains it not only geopolitically, but they violated the flower of their youth.I think I'd remember that for a long time."It's not known exactly how many women served as so-called comfort women but the Japanese government disputes the purported figure of 200,000 across Asia.The UN has found that "comfort stations" that provided forced sexual slaves for Japanese military began as early as 1932, nearly 10 years before it became a more widely known and regular practice."The first military sexual slaves were Korean from the North Kyushu area of Japan, and were sent at the request of one of the commanding officers of the army," the UN wrote in its report.The Japanese, it wrote, "were able to procure more women for the increasing demands of the army by using violence and outright coercion."- CNN
